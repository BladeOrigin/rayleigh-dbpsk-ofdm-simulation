# üì° rayleigh-dbpsk-ofdm-simulation - Simulate Wireless Channels Easily

## üåê Overview
This repository provides MATLAB simulations for analyzing hostile wireless channels. You will explore important features such as Rayleigh fading, Doppler effects, and delay spread. The simulations focus on two key modulation types: DBPSK and OFDM. You can also analyze the Bit Error Rate (BER) against Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and bitrate.
